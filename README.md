Lambda Interpreter

TESC Winter/Spring 2019

This is a simple lambda interpreter parsing is currently not supported, the abstract sytax is directly evaluated. In the file interpreter

The implementation takes inspiration from Pierce (ISBN:978-0262162098) and Sellinger (https://arxiv.org/pdf/0804.3434.pdf)

# BNF Abstract syntax #

Term ::= If <Term> <Term> <Term> | Succ <Term> | Prd <Term> |
         Z | T | F | Lam <Name> <Name> | Var <Name> | Pair <Term> <Term>
         | Pair1 <Term> <Term> | Pair2 <Term> <Term> | EmptyList | List <Term> <Term>
         | Head <Term> | Tail <Term> | IsNil <Term> | Fix <Term> | Type <Type> | TypeOf <Term> | Seq <Term> <Term>
         | UnitTerm

Type ::= Nat | Bool | Arrow <Type> <Type> | Cross <Type> <Type> |  A <Name> | Unit | ListType <Type>

Name ::= string

# How to Get started #

Clone the repo then compile interpreter.lhs and try to figure it out. 

# A Few Things #

Fix <Term> is the fixed point combinator, the language allows recursion and as such is not normalizing and can have endless loops so beware.

List <Term> <Term> the first term is the head and the second term is either a list or the EmptyList term

IsNil <Term> is for lists 

TypeOf <Term> is just like haskells ghci ":t" command

Seq <Term> <Term> will create a sequence where Term1 needs to return a term of type Unit whereat Term2 is evaluated afterwards. (I am not sure of the use of this quite yet)
